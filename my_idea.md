# Readability Repo Purpose in English Major
This is text about the repo:
The readability repository is a valuable tool for English studies and writing because it helps measure how easy or difficult a piece of text is to read. Using the new Dale-Chall readability formula, the tool provides a precise estimate of the grade level required to understand a text. This is especially useful for students, teachers, and writers who want to ensure that their writing matches the reading ability of their audience. In English composition and linguistics, readability analysis supports lessons on tone, clarity, and audience adaptation. Moreover, since the tool can calculate both readability and cloze scores, it encourages awareness of sentence structure, vocabulary selection, and information density. Overall, this repository helps English majors critically evaluate and refine their writing to achieve better communication and accessibility.
